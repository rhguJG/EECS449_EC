## Feature I add
For Part 3, I implemented a **dark mode theme toggle** for the todo app UI.

- The app starts in **light mode**.
- A theme button in the header lets the user switch between **Light** and **Dark**.
- In dark mode, the background, text, inputs, buttons, and category badges are
  restyled to maintain contrast and readability.
